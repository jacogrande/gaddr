# Design Kit Pipeline — Plan

## Product Context Summary

Microblogger is a micro-essay continuous learning studio where knowledge workers write short (200-800 word) evidence-backed essays and receive LLM coaching — never ghostwriting. Users build a "thinking portfolio" with version history, claim-evidence linking, and structured peer feedback. The product philosophy is "writing gym, not writing machine" — practice over performance, coaching over generating, constraints create craft. The three core MVP screens are: **Editor** (writing + inline comments + checklist), **Evidence Library** (research packets + evidence cards), and **Publish Page** (readable essay + expandable evidence + objections). The emotional tone is trustworthy, practice-oriented, evidence-backed, and intellectually warm — not flashy, not corporate, not gamified. Built with Next.js App Router and Tailwind CSS, responsive-first.

### 2. ink-and-paper

**Description:** Stripped to the absolute essentials, like writing with a good pen on quality paper. Near-monochrome with a barely-there warm undertone. The interface disappears so the writing can breathe. Brutalist minimalism softened by warmth.

**Key characteristics:**
- Color mood: paper white (#FDFCFA), true black text, single warm accent (terracotta #C05A3C)
- Typography: single serif family for everything (Newsreader), weight variation for hierarchy
- Spacing: extremely generous — maximum whitespace, narrow content column
- Corners: sharp edges (0px radius) — honest and direct
- Energy: monastic, focused, almost meditative

**Reference touchstones:** iA Writer, Bear app, Hemingway Editor

### 3. library-study

**Description:** Rich and layered, like writing at a mahogany desk in a private study. Deeper warm tones — walnut, hunter green, aged gold — with subtle texture in the design language. More ambient and immersive than the other directions.

**Key characteristics:**
- Color mood: warm dark backgrounds (#2C2520), cream text, forest green (#3D6B50), gold (#C9A84C)
- Typography: classic serif (Merriweather) with structured sans (Source Sans 3) for UI
- Spacing: medium density — cozy rather than sparse
- Corners: moderate rounding (6-8px), deeper shadows for layered depth
- Energy: immersive, scholarly, intimate — evening writing session

**Reference touchstones:** Notion in dark mode, old leather-bound book aesthetics, Readwise

### 4. soft-clay

**Description:** Earthy and organic, with muted terracotta, sage, and sandstone tones. Softly rounded shapes create an approachable, craft-workshop feeling. Warm but lighter and more playful than the editorial direction.

**Key characteristics:**

- Energy: approachable, grounded, handmade — a pottery studio vibe

**Reference touchstones:** Are.na, Readwise Reader, Linear (for the softness)

### 5. pressed-type

**Description:** Bold typographic confidence inspired by letterpress printing and editorial design. High-contrast black and white foundation with a single strong accent. The type itself is the design — large, assertive serifs and a rigid grid.

**Key characteristics:**
- Color mood: stark white (#FFFFFF), true black (#111111), single bold accent (vermillion #E04B2F)
- Typography: bold display serif (Playfair Display 700+) for headings, geometric sans (Inter) for body
- Spacing: tight grid with strong rhythm — columnar, structured
- Corners: mixed — sharp for containers, pill for buttons (deliberate contrast)
- Energy: confident, graphic, editorial — a broadsheet newspaper's opinion section

**Reference touchstones:** Bloomberg Opinion, The Outline (RIP), Figma's marketing site
