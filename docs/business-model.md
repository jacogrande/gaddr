# Business Model — Micro-Essay Continuous Learning Studio (No-Ghostwriting)

## 0) One-line thesis

A subscription product that turns writing into **a daily skill loop**: users publish short, evidence-backed micro-essays, while an LLM acts as a **coach + researcher + sparring partner**—**never a co-author**.

---

## 1) Market context and why this model can win

### 1.1 Macro tailwinds

- The “creator economy” is projected to grow substantially over the next few years; Goldman Sachs estimates creator economy total addressable market could roughly double to **$480B by 2027** (from ~$250B). ([Goldman Sachs][1])
- Publishing infrastructure keeps improving: Ghost reports publisher earnings on its platform have surpassed **$100M** and highlights continued investment in distribution tooling. ([ghost.org][2])

### 1.2 The gap you’re targeting

Most writing products optimize either:

1. **Output** (AI writes/rewrites), or
2. **Publishing** (audience/monetization), or
3. **Research** (find sources), or
4. **Habits** (streaks), or
5. **Argument mapping** (logic trees).

Your wedge is **integration** around _learning and integrity_:

- Users keep full authorship (trust + identity)
- Feedback + argument diagnostics are explainable (coach-like)
- Research is converted into “evidence cards” linked to claims
- Publishing rewards revision and reasoning, not hot takes

---

## 2) Target customers and “jobs to be done”

### 2.1 ICP (initial)

**Continuous learners who want to sharpen thinking in public or semi-public**

- Knowledge workers (PM/eng/design/strategy), founders, analysts
- People building a “thinking portfolio” (career mobility, credibility)
- Curious readers who want to become better writers (not “become famous writers”)

### 2.2 Core jobs

- “Help me write regularly even when I’m busy”
- “Make my argument clearer, tighter, and more defensible”
- “Help me find and use evidence quickly”
- “Help me stress-test my viewpoint with the best counterarguments”
- “Give me a publishing home that feels credible”

---

## 3) Value proposition (what you sell)

### 3.1 The product promise

**Better thinking through better writing—without outsourcing authorship.**

### 3.2 The “No-Ghostwriting” stance as a moat

Many mainstream writing assistants offer generative composing/rewriting. For example, Grammarly promotes on-demand generative assistance that can “compose” and “rewrite.” ([Grammarly Support][3])
Your stance is the opposite: the system can **criticize, question, and research**, but never “swap in” sentences. That gives you:

- **Trust** (readers believe the author wrote it)
- **Skill transfer** (users get better over time)
- **Less commoditization** (you’re not competing on “best rewrite”)

---

## 4) Competitive positioning

### 4.1 How you’re different (in plain language)

- Versus publishing platforms: you’re “a coaching gym + publishing,” not “a newsletter CMS.”
- Versus research assistants: you’re “research → argument → publish,” not “answers.”
- Versus AI writing tools: you’re “feedback + integrity,” not “generation.”
- Versus habit apps: you’re “habit + quality,” not “word count.”

### 4.2 Positioning table (feature-level)

Legend: **++ strong**, **+ present**, **– not a focus**.

**Interpretation:** You’re positioned as a _new category intersection_: **learning-grade writing coach + argumentation + research workflow + lightweight publishing**. The “no-ghostwriting” constraint is a clean trust differentiator in a world where many tools can rewrite content. ([Grammarly Support][3])

## 5) Revenue model and pricing strategy

### 5.1 Primary revenue: subscription (B2C)

**Why subscription fits:** users pay for _repeated coaching loops_ and progress tracking, not one-off outputs.

**Tiering idea (example)**

- **Free**
  - Limited coaching passes/week
  - Basic rubric (clarity, structure)
  - Limited research packets
  - Publish public/unlisted

- **Pro ($12–$20/mo)**
  - Higher coaching quota + deeper “review modes”
  - Advanced rubric modules (argument, evidence alignment, counterarguments)
  - Larger research quota (evidence cards)
  - Progress dashboard (skill growth)
  - Prompt tracks + challenges

- **Pro+ (power users)**
  - Highest quotas
  - “Debate pack” mode (best counterargument set + citations)
  - Priority models / faster turnaround

**Important:** “Unlimited” should be framed as “generous quotas” to protect margins.

### 5.2 Secondary revenue: community plans (clubs/cohorts)

A “writing gym” is naturally group-based.

- Private groups
- Weekly challenges
- Peer review workflows
- Moderation and prompts
- Group analytics

You can sell this to:

- learning communities
- Slack/Discord clubs
- professional associations

### 5.3 Optional expansion: creator monetization rails (careful)

If you later add paid memberships, understand the landscape:

- Substack is commonly described as taking a **platform fee on paid subscriptions** (often cited as 10% + payment processing). ([SchoolMaker][8])
- Medium describes Partner Program earnings tied to member reading time and positive interactions. ([Medium][6])
- Ghost emphasizes **0% transaction fees** beyond payment processor fees. ([ghost.org][7])

**Your best play:** don’t compete with these rails early. Instead:

- Export/cross-post to them
- Offer monetization as _an add-on later_, once you have retention

---

## 6) Unit economics and cost control (LLM-heavy but manageable)

### 6.1 What costs money

- LLM inference for: rubric scoring, comment generation, argument extraction
- Web research retrieval + summarization
- Storage/versioning
- Moderation/support

### 6.2 Design that keeps LLM costs sane

Because you do **evaluation** more than **generation**, you can structure calls tightly:

- **Short, structured outputs** (JSON comments/issues, not long prose)
- **Anchored feedback**: only analyze changed sections on subsequent passes
- **Caching**: evidence cards stored and reused
- **Modes**: “Fast Review” vs “Deep Review” priced/limited differently
- **Batching**: run review at deliberate moments (submit, publish), not per keystroke

### 6.3 Credit-based internal accounting

Even if you sell “Pro,” internally treat actions as credits:

- Deep review = X credits
- Research packet = Y credits
- Debate pack = Z credits

This protects gross margin while still feeling simple to users.

---

## 7) Distribution and go-to-market (GTM)

### 7.1 The core growth loop

1. User publishes a micro-essay
2. Link is shared
3. Reader sees claim-evidence structure + objections
4. Reader tries the “daily prompt challenge”
5. Streak/skill tracking drives retention

### 7.2 Acquisition channels

- **Daily prompt challenges** (habit engine)
- **Topical tracks** (“30 days of…”)
- **Communities** (clubs/cohorts) as “B2B2C”
- **Integrations/export** to existing networks (Substack/Medium/Ghost)

### 7.3 Why your product can coexist with big publishers

Substack’s Notes explicitly supports short-form posting inside its network. ([Substack Support][5])
Instead of competing on audience first, you compete on **practice + quality + credibility**, then let users distribute wherever they already have reach.

---

## 8) Product packaging that supports monetization (what’s “paid”)

### 8.1 Paid = depth + frequency + progress

Users will pay for:

- More frequent review passes
- Stronger argumentation diagnostics
- Better research packets (more sources, better quote extraction, higher reliability notes)
- Personal progress dashboards (skill deltas over time)
- Premium prompt tracks and “debate challenges”

### 8.2 Free = habit + taste of value

Free should still let people:

- Write daily
- Publish
- Get some feedback
- See progress starting

Then Pro sells “serious training.”

---

## 9) Risk model and mitigations (business-critical)

### 9.1 Trust & credibility risk (citations mismatch)

Mitigation:

- Evidence cards require quote snippets + link
- “Claim not supported by citation” warnings
- Encourage “opinion” labeling when no evidence exists

### 9.2 Moderation & platform risk

If you host publishing, you inherit moderation burdens. Keep the publishing layer:

- lightweight at first (unlisted/public)
- with reporting and rate limits
- with clear rules and escalation processes

### 9.3 Commoditization risk (AI tools everywhere)

Your moat is the **constraint**:

- You’re not “another generator”
- You’re a “coach with receipts” + skill tracking + community accountability

---

## 10) 12-month business roadmap (tied to revenue milestones)

### Phase 1 (0–3 months): Prove retention

- Daily prompts + streaks
- Basic review pass (clarity/structure)
- Evidence cards (source → quote → attach to claim)
- Simple publishing pages

**Goal:** strong week-4 retention among writers

### Phase 2 (3–6 months): Monetize Pro

- Deep Review mode + argument diagnostics
- Progress dashboard (skills over time)
- First Pro tier launch

**Goal:** sustainable LLM costs per retained user

### Phase 3 (6–12 months): Communities

- Clubs/cohorts product
- Peer objections workflow
- Admin tooling

**Goal:** higher ARPU through group plans

---

## 11) Key metrics (business dashboard)

- Activation: % who publish within 24h
- Habit: WAU/MAU, streak continuation
- Quality behaviors: citations/essay, counterargument rate, revision-after-feedback rate
- Revenue: free→pro conversion, churn, ARPU, cohort LTV
- Cost: inference cost per WAU, % “heavy users” hitting limits
- Community health: report rate, constructive objection rate
